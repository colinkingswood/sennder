I noticed when developing this that there were a number of films that didn't have corresponding entries in teh people endpoint.
Under normal circumstances i would ask what the preferred option would be in this case. FDor just now I added a string "Unknown" to the output.

Testing is a large topic and it would be easy to add way more than what I did.
For the time being I wanted to test the cache refresh option, which was a bit trickier than I expected.

I added a timestamp "last_refreshed" to the context data returned from the view in order to check if the data had been had changed (you can see this a the bottom of the list).
It worked while manually testing but when retrieving from cache the context data wasn't added to the response object in the test, so I used a lack of context object to infer that the cached copy was being used. The context data gets added after 60 seconds when teh cache is refreshed.

Other tests that could be added - it would be nice to add some mock endpoints that change between requests but it would be a relatively time consuming task to set these up.

Another test could be to refactor the logic for matching films and people into a separate function with data as parameters, then set up data to check if teh output is as expected. Again this would take as much time as writing teh code itself.

I added some "todos" in the code where to to handle errors if the call to the endpoints don't return a valid response, for teh time being I assume that they will work correctly.

At present it just uses Djangos in memory caching. For a production application, setting up memcached or Reddis may  be a better option. Also Django's development server isn't recommended for production use.
